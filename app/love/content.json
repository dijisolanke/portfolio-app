  "text": "<strong>The couple</strong> \n Good Combo. \n Energetic outgoing nature mixed with calm introspective. \n Good balance of light and darkness \n Equal potential for chaos and harmony. \n Both have wild-card energy 🤌\n\nThey are NOT GORP-Core \nThey are gorgeous human beings with a lot of kindness between them.\n\n ⎯⎯⎯⎯ \n\n The programmer who wrote this reckons they have a very strong chance of finding and maintaining harmonic balance as they transition into the post honeymoon phase of relationship known as the 'Power struggle' phase. \n\n Success in this stage will hinge on their ability to appreciate each other's differences rather than see them as obstacles to fix or change. \n There are two main ways it usually goes. \n\n <strong>The bad way:</strong> \n Find someone > \n Fall in love with them for their differences > \n Forget that crucial detail over time and try to change them in a way that strips them of their beauty > \n Break up > \n Rinse repeat  \n\n <strong>The Good way:</strong> \n Recognize differences exist > \n Remember everyone's got some bullshit > \n Figure out the best way to lead eachother. \n\n <strong>Good news: \n There's strong signs of mutual respect and willingness to accept influence from each other</strong> \n\n <strong>Things to Avoid: \n Using a phrase like 'As usual, you did so and so..' as criticism of ones entire character tend to shift the criticized person into a defensive state. where possible, try limit the scope of the critique to the moment / situation at hand \n\n Avoid Avoiding. Arguments can be very useful. Just don't do it for sport cos.. why do that to your bestie.</strong>"
